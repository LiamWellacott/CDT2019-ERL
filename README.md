# CDT2019-ERL

This is a competition entry for the European Robotic League and part of our PhD work at the Edinburgh Centre for Robotics Centre for Doctoral Training in Robotics and Autonomous Systems. The goal of this project is to produce a software system which is:

- Competitive, i.e. software supporting HWU ECR entries to this type of competitions (ERL, Robocup@Home, METRICS...).
- Flexible, modular, and easy to configure software (teams typically have half a day / one day) to configure their system to operate in the test-bed where the tournament takes place - ideally most of which should be usable for both HSR and Tiago
- Robust (keep things simple, consider an integration and testing plan)

In addition to the code available in this repo we have produced a [demonstration video]() and [team description paper]().

## Set up

## Change protocol

**You must have your own fork to contribute to the project**, we will use a pull request model for managing contributions each change must be reviewed before merging is allowed.

## Info/useful links for team members

### Other Project Sites
- [Sharepoint](https://heriotwatt.sharepoint.com/sites/CDT2019-ERL) for project documentation, you must use your HW credentials to access, non HW accounts cannot be added to this.
- [Overleaf report](https://www.overleaf.com/read/tbvrxpjrnrkt) for paper (tell me your email to be added as collaborator)

### Resources 
- The main source of information is the [consumer page of the competition website](https://www.eu-robotics.net/robotics_league/erl-consumer/about/index.html), here you can find the [https://www.eu-robotics.net/robotics_league/upload/documents-2018/ERL_Consumer_10092018.pdf](rulebook) which contains detailed descriptions of the tasks to be completed. Some additional information on the [test environments](https://www.eu-robotics.net/robotics_league/erl-consumer/certified-test-beds/index.html) and specifically the [Edinburgh test environment](https://www.eu-robotics.net/robotics_league/upload/documents-2017/ERL-SR_TestBedCertificationForm_HWU_web.pdf)
- Home page for the [Edinburgh assisted living testbed](https://ralt.hw.ac.uk/)
- Some notes on possible [tools/algorithms](https://heriotwatt.sharepoint.com/sites/CDT2019-ERL/_layouts/15/doc.aspx?sourcedoc={c50ef375-786c-45bd-8ff7-3e8696c3442a}&action=edit) which may be useful for coming up with a solution.
