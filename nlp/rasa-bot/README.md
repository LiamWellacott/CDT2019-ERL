# Ubuntu dependencies
``` bash
sudo apt install -y python3-dev python3-pip python3-venv
```

# Create python environment
- Navigate to Rasa-bot
- It is important to use environment as the dependencies for rasa conflict with the dependencies for speech IO

``` bash

source ./rasa/bin/activate
```

# Pip Dependencies
``` bash
pip3 install --upgrade pip
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

# Run Rasa
- Use `rasa train` to train model
- Run `rasa run actions --actions actions.actions` first
- Use `rasa shell` to run rasa in the terminal or use `rasa run` to run as a web service (use curl to test. See below)

# Test Rasa REST API
``` bash
curl -i -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"sender\":\"test_user\", \"message\":\"Hello Tiago\"}" http://localhost:5005/webhooks/rest/webhook
